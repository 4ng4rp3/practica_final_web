# vue-phaser3

#### Webpack boilerplate that integrates Phaser 3 into a Vue project.

This project template has been set up using the **Vue CLI 3** and includes:
* *Sass*
* *CSS postprocessing*
* *Babel*

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with live reloading at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with transpilation / minification
npm run build

# serve your production build at localhost:5000
npm run serve
```

## Extending the project to your needs

If you want to add more features like *linting*, *unit testing* or *Typescript* to
your own project, you can do so quite easily via Vue CLI's plugin system. Check
out the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/" target="_blank">documentation</a>
if you want to know more.
